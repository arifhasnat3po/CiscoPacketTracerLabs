Network Routing Protocols
This repository contains examples and configurations for various network routing protocols including RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, static, and dynamic routing.

Router RIP
The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses hop count as the metric to determine the best path between networks. In this repository, you can find examples of how to configure RIP on Cisco routers and how to troubleshoot common issues.

OSPF
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a link-state routing protocol that uses cost as the metric to determine the best path between networks. This repository contains configurations and examples of OSPF in different network topologies, as well as how to optimize OSPF to achieve better network performance.

VLAN
A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a logical grouping of network devices that share a common set of requirements. VLANs can be used to improve network security, manage traffic, and reduce broadcast traffic. This repository provides examples of how to configure VLANs on Cisco switches and how to troubleshoot common VLAN issues.

ACL
Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to control network traffic based on source and destination addresses, protocols, and port numbers. ACLs can be used to filter traffic, restrict access, and protect the network from malicious traffic. In this repository, you can find examples of how to configure ACLs on Cisco routers and switches and how to troubleshoot common ACL issues.

EIGRP
Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a Cisco proprietary routing protocol that uses bandwidth, delay, reliability, and load as the metric to determine the best path between networks. This repository contains examples and configurations of EIGRP in different network topologies, as well as how to optimize EIGRP to achieve better network performance.

Static
Static routing is a type of routing that uses a fixed path to forward network traffic. Static routing can be used to connect networks that are not configured with a dynamic routing protocol or to override dynamic routing protocols. This repository provides examples of how to configure static routing on Cisco routers and how to troubleshoot common static routing issues.

Dynamic
Dynamic routing protocols are used to automatically exchange network routing information between routers. Dynamic routing protocols can be used to optimize network performance, reduce network congestion, and increase network availability. In this repository, you can find examples and configurations of dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, and RIP.
